  # No `depends_on xcode` — Homebrew enforces it as full Xcode.app, which
  # most macOS users don't have. The Swift toolchain that ships with Apple's
  # Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`) compiles this package fine.
  # If `swift` isn't on PATH at install time, Homebrew's build will fail with
  # a clear "swift: command not found" — much friendlier than blocking
  # everyone-without-the-full-IDE up front.
